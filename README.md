This is our RDC 2022 gamejam submission, "Consequence". Use a magical lantern to shift backwards and forwards in time, overcoming obstacles that you directly created as a consequence of your actions!

Worked on by [Noble_Draconian](https://www.roblox.com/users/73223877/profile), [Spathi](https://www.roblox.com/users/51460411/profile) and [RegalChalice / Scylen](https://www.roblox.com/users/29450075/profile).

🐉HERE BE DRAGONS🐉

This code was written while I was in a sleep-deprived state, having been up for more than 24 hours for the gamejam. Please take the code here with a grain of salt, some of the code here is messy and rushed.
